# ADC Domain Profiles

Domain profiles extend the ADC core specification for specific operational contexts. A profile defines normative field usage, required constraints, recommended escalation patterns, and example ADCs for a specific deployment domain.

The core ADC schema is domain-invariant. Profiles are how domain-specific requirements are expressed without modifying the core.

## Contributing a Profile

If you have domain expertise in one of the placeholder domains, your contribution is needed. Open an issue labeled `new-profile` describing your domain context and which ADC primitives require extension or normative guidance.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full RFC process.
